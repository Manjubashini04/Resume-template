        <h3><b>Projects:</b></h3>
        <h4>Medical Assistant Chatbot Using RAG</h4>
        <p>Developed a chatbot that provides medical assistance based on a given PDF input.
            Employed RAG to retrieve relevant information from the PDF and generate informative responses.
            Utilized the BioMistral LLM model for training the chatbot, resulting in a highly accurate and helpful medical assistant.
        </p>
        <h4>Story Teller Application</h4>
        <p>Built an AI web application that uses NLP to convert text into a story format.
            Employed a sophisticated NLP pipeline that included tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and semantic analysis to extract the key elements of the input text and transform it into a coherent narrative. The pipeline effectively identified the main characters, plot points, and themes, allowing the application to generate engaging and well-structured stories.
        </p>
        <h4>Movie Recommendation Using RPA</h4>
        <p>Developed an RPA solution to suggest movies based on user-provided reviews.
            Utilized UiPath, a leading RPA platform, to automate the process of extracting movie reviews from online sources, analyzing the sentiment of the reviews, and matching them with relevant movies in a database..
        </p>
        <h4>Quote Generator Using Prompt Engineering</h4>
        <p>Created a quote generator that generates insightful and inspiring quotes based on user-defined prompts.
            Employed prompt engineering techniques to craft effective prompts that guide the language model towards generating high-quality quotes.
            Utilized a powerful language model, such as GPT-3, to generate the quotes based on the provided prompts.
