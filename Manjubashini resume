        <ul>
        <li><h4>Medical Assistant Chatbot Using RAG</h4></li>
        <p>Developed a chatbot that provides medical assistance based on a given PDF input.
            Employed RAG to retrieve relevant information from the PDF and generate informative responses.
            Utilized the BioMistral LLM model for training the chatbot, resulting in a highly accurate and helpful medical assistant.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Story Teller Application</h4></li>
        <p>Built an AI web application that uses NLP to convert text into a story format.
            Employed a sophisticated NLP pipeline that included tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and semantic analysis to extract the key elements of the input text and transform it into a coherent narrative. The pipeline effectively identified the main characters, plot points, and themes, allowing the application to generate engaging and well-structured stories.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Movie Recommendation Using RPA</h4></li>
